1. Project Overview
Aura is a symbiotic rural intelligence platform designed to transform fragmented rural ecosystems into cohesive, data-driven communities. It focuses on resource efficiency, market leverage, and long-term sustainability.

2. Functional Requirements
Ecosystem Digital Twin: The system must integrate satellite imagery (Sentinel-2) and IoT sensor data to provide a real-time heatmap of soil and water health.

Collective Crop Weaver: The AI must analyze market price trends and historical yields to recommend a diversified planting strategy for the community.

Common Gear Logistics: The platform must provide a peer-to-peer (P2P) routing engine for shared machinery using GPS and path-optimization algorithms.

Multilingual Voice Oracle: Users must be able to interact with the system via voice notes (NLP) to receive agricultural advice in local dialects.

Offline Diagnostics: The mobile interface must support on-device (Edge AI) computer vision for pest and disease detection without an internet connection.

3. Non-Functional Requirements
Scalability: The backend must handle horizontal scaling via AWS to support thousands of concurrent sensor streams.

Accessibility: The UI must be optimized for low-literacy users, prioritizing icons and voice over dense text.

Privacy: The system must utilize Federated Learning to ensure that communal land data remains private and decentralized.

Resilience: The "Offline-First" architecture must ensure data integrity during frequent connectivity drops.
